Budget Insight and Monitoring System Using Budget Pacing Algorithm.



1. HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW
This engine provides personalized financial recommendations to users based on:

Their budget categories

Their actual spending (transactions)

And how their spending pace compares to an ideal pace

The Engine Has Three Core Parts:
Orchestrator – Controls the process

Budget Pacing Algorithm – The core logic that evaluates each budget

Enhancements – Adds overall summaries, handles edge cases, and provides backup advice

2. THE ORCHESTRATOR: generateRecommendations
This is the main controller. Think of it as the CEO that delegates tasks and compiles the final result. Here's how it operates:

Inputs:
userId

List of the user’s budgets

List of the user’s transactions

What It Does Step-by-Step:
Step 1: Loop Through Each Budget
It iterates over each budget category — e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment.

Step 2: Calculate Total Spending for Each
For each budget, it sums up all the spending (from the transaction list) for this month.

Step 3: Call the Budget Pacing Algorithm
This algorithm receives the budget and the total spent so far. It analyzes the spending pace and returns a recommendation (e.g., “Warning”, “Positive”).

Step 4: Compile Overall Summary
After analyzing all individual budgets, the Orchestrator evaluates the user’s overall financial pace. It compares total spent across all budgets with total budget.

Step 5: Fallback to General Tips
If fewer than 3 recommendations are generated, it adds general financial advice so the user always gets helpful output.

Step 6: Return Final List
The Orchestrator returns a final, combined list of recommendations to be displayed on the UI.

3. BUDGET PACING ALGORITHM
This is the analytical engine. It’s called for each budget and returns a specific message based on how spending compares to an “ideal” pattern.

A. Key Concepts:
1. Ideal Spending (idealSpentByNow)
This is how much a user should have spent by today if they were spending evenly.

Formula:
idealSpentByNow = (budget amount / days in month) * current day

Example:
If budget = $300 for June (30 days), and today is June 10:
Ideal spend by now = (300 / 30) * 10 = $100

2. Pace Percentage (pacePercentage)
This tells you how fast the user is spending relative to the ideal.

Formula:
pacePercentage = (actual spent / idealSpentByNow) * 100

If result = 150%, they’re spending 50% faster

If result = 50%, they’re spending 50% slower

This is the core indicator that drives all the recommendations.

B. Recommendation Tiers (based on pacePercentage)
The algorithm returns one of four messages, based on thresholds:

1. Warning – Spending is above 100%
Means they’re likely to overspend.

If already over budget, it says how much is overspent.

If not yet over, it projects the future overspend:

Projected Overspend = (dailyRate * daysLeft) - remainingBudget

2. Caution – Spending is 90% to 100%
Slightly fast spending

Estimates how many days until the budget will run out if pace continues.

3. Info – Spending is 61% to 89%
Spending is in a healthy, expected range.

Gives a thumbs-up message.

4. Positive – Spending is below 60%
Shows strong control.

Reinforces good behavior.


A. Handling No Spending
If a user hasn't spent anything in a category yet, it:

Skips the pacing algorithm

Outputs: "No spending recorded for [category] yet. Your full budget of [$amount] is available."


5. WHY THIS MATTERS — Tactical Utility
For the User:
Gives real-time financial feedback

Helps course-correct spending before it's too late

Reinforces good habits

For the Business:
Drives engagement and retention by delivering personal value

Creates a feedback loop that nudges users toward healthier spending

Scales personalization with minimal manual input

6. HOW YOU THINK LIKE THE SYSTEM (Mental Model)
When reading or designing this logic, think in terms of:

Time-based performance (where should I be by now?)

Relative pace (how am I doing compared to ideal?)

Tiered messaging (which bracket am I in?)

User psychology (how do we deliver feedback that’s useful, not overwhelming?)

Fallback safety nets (always give something, even if the data is sparse)
