Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Introduction
Managing personal finances is a challenge that almost everyone faces, whether you are a student, a working professional, or running a household. With so many ways to spend and receive money cash, cards, online payments, and mobile wallets. It is easy to lose track of where your money goes. Many people try to keep records in notebooks or on their phones, but these methods are often messy, easy to forget, or too basic to give a real understanding of their financial situation. This is where digital solutions come in.
The Personal Finance Tracking System (PFTS) was created to make managing money easier and smarter for everyone. The main idea behind PFTS is to give users a simple, friendly web application where they can record their income and expenses, set budgets for different categories like food, rent, or transportation, and get helpful advice on how to stay on track. Unlike many apps that only show numbers, PFTS uses a budget pacing algorithm to give users real-time feedback and suggestions. This means the system doesn’t just tell you how much you have spent; it tells you if you are spending at a healthy rate, gives you warnings if you are spending too fast, and encourages you when you are doing well. The whole system is built to be easy to use, visually clear, and genuinely helpful for everyday people.
1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional ways of managing personal finance, such as keeping notes or using basic spreadsheets, are often not enough for today’s fast-moving world. People face several challenges when trying to control their spending and saving habits. PFTS aims to address these issues by providing a smarter, more user-friendly solution. Some key challenges include:
•	Difficulty in tracking every income and expense accurately.
•	Lack of real-time feedback on spending habits.
•	No clear warnings before overspending occurs.
•	Existing apps are either too simple or too complicated for average users.
•	Absence of personalized advice or guidance for better money management.
•	Users struggle to stick to budgets and often lose motivation.
1.3 Objectives
The main objectives of the Personal Finance Tracking System (PFTS) include:
•	To provide an easy way to record every income and expense.
•	To allow users to set up and manage budgets for different categories.
•	To use a budget pacing algorithm to give real-time advice and warnings.
1.4 Scope and Limitations
1.4.1 Scope
The scopes of PFTS include:
•	User registration and secure authentication.
•	Adding, editing, and deleting income and expense transactions.
•	Setting up and managing budgets for different categories (e.g., food, rent, travel).
•	Providing dashboard summaries and simple charts for easy understanding.
•	Giving real-time feedback and recommendations using the budget pacing algorithm.
•	Allowing users to export their data as CSV files.
1.4.2 Limitations
The limitations of PFTS include:
•	Single-user system (no group or family budgeting).
•	Does not connect directly to bank accounts; all entries must be made manually.
•	No mobile app version (web only, but mobile-friendly).
•	No support for investment or asset tracking beyond basic income/expense.
1.5 Development Methodology
For the development of PFT, an agile methodology was adopted to ensure iterative progress, flexibility, and responsiveness to feedback. The development process was structured into multiple phases, referred to as sprints, with each sprint targeting a specific set of features.

Each sprint followed a systematic agile process, beginning with sprint planning to define the scope and objectives. This was followed by the creation of mockup designs for the planned features, which guided the development phase. The developed features were then rigorously tested to identify and address any bugs or errors, ensuring continuous improvement and a high-quality outcome.

Chapter 2: Background Study and Literature Review
2.1 Background Study
Managing personal finances has always been an essential aspect of everyday life. Traditionally, people relied on handwritten notes, cash ledgers, or simple spreadsheets to keep track of their income and expenses. However, as financial transactions have become more frequent and complex due to the rise of digital payments, online shopping, and diverse income sources these manual methods have proven to be insufficient for most users.
In response to these challenges, digital solutions have been developed to simplify and enhance the process of personal finance management. Early desktop applications and spreadsheet templates allowed for more accurate record-keeping and easier calculations, but still required significant manual effort. With the advent of the internet and smartphones, web-based and mobile applications have become increasingly popular, enabling users to manage their finances anytime and anywhere.
Despite these advancements, many users still face obstacles such as difficulty in tracking all transactions, lack of real-time feedback, and concerns over privacy and data security [1]. Especially in regions where digital banking is still developing, users prefer solutions that balance simplicity, privacy, and usefulness [2].
The Personal Finance Tracking System (PFTS) was designed to address these needs by providing a user-friendly, web-based platform that helps individuals record their financial activities, set budgets, and receive timely recommendations. By combining the accessibility of modern technology with a focus on clear guidance and privacy, PFTS aims to make personal finance management practical and effective for a wide range of users.





2.2 Literature Review
Personal finance management has become an increasingly important area of research and development as individuals seek better ways to track their income, expenses, and savings. Early studies in behavioral economics highlighted that people often make systematic errors in managing their finances, such as underestimating expenses or failing to save regularly [1]. Financial literacy has been shown to play a crucial role in helping individuals make informed decisions and achieve better financial outcomes [2].
With the advancement of technology, a wide range of personal finance applications have emerged to address these challenges. Applications like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), and PocketGuard offer features such as automated expense tracking, budget planning, and real-time notifications to help users stay on top of their finances. Mint, for example, connects to users’ bank accounts, categorizes transactions automatically, and provides visual summaries of spending patterns [6]. YNAB focuses on proactive budgeting and encourages users to assign every dollar a specific job, promoting disciplined spending habits [7]. PocketGuard provides a simplified overview of available funds and alerts users when they are close to overspending [8]. While these applications have made personal finance management more accessible, they also present concerns related to privacy, data security, and complexity for new users [5][6].
Academic research supports the effectiveness of digital tools in improving financial behavior, especially when users receive regular feedback and reminders [3]. The usability and design of these tools are also critical, as complicated interfaces can discourage regular use and reduce the benefits of financial tracking [4]. In the context of Nepal and other developing countries, studies have shown that adoption of personal finance apps is growing, but barriers such as limited digital banking infrastructure and privacy concerns remain significant [5].
The Personal Finance Tracking System (PFTS) builds upon these findings by offering a user-friendly, privacy-conscious solution that provides real-time feedback through a budget pacing algorithm. Unlike some existing tools, PFTS does not require users to link their bank accounts, focusing instead on manual entry and clear, actionable recommendations. This approach aims to balance simplicity, security, and effectiveness, making financial management accessible to a wider audience.

4.2 Algorithm Details
Budget Pacing Algorithm: 
The budget pacing algorithm in PFTS is designed to give users continuous, precise feedback about their spending patterns, helping them proactively manage budgets and avoid overspending. It not only checks if users are on track but also projects future spending, issues early warnings, and provides actionable recommendations.
Step-by-Step Process
1. Data Preparation and Time Calculation
•	The algorithm starts by determining the user’s total budget for a specific category and month.
•	It calculates the total number of days in the month and identifies the current day.
•	This allows the system to compute how much of the month has elapsed, as well as the days remaining.
2. Actual Spending Aggregation
•	All expense transactions for the chosen category and month are aggregated.
•	The sum gives the actual amount spent so far (spent).
3. Ideal Spending and Pace Calculation
•	The algorithm calculates the “ideal” amount the user should have spent by today if spending were perfectly distributed:
IdealSpentByNow = (TotalBudget / DaysInMonth) * DaysPassed
•	It also computes the daily spending rate and projects the total spending for the month:
DailyRate = Spent / DaysPassed
ProjectedSpending = DailyRate * DaysInMonth
4. Pacing and Budget Health Analysis
•	The algorithm determines the user’s spending pace as a percentage:
PacePercentage = (Spent / IdealSpentByNow) * 100
•	It calculates the remaining budget and the daily budget for the rest of the month:
Remaining = TotalBudget - Spent
DailyBudget = (Remaining) / (DaysInMonth - DaysPassed)
5. Feedback and Recommendation Generation
The algorithm evaluates the user’s current status:
•	Overspending: If projected spending exceeds the total budget, a strong warning is issued.
•	On Track: If the pace is within a healthy range (e.g., 90–110%), positive feedback is provided.
•	Underspending: If the user is well below the ideal pace, they are congratulated and encouraged to maintain discipline.
•	Critical Warning: If the user has used more than 90% of the budget early in the month, a critical alert is shown.
Feedback is delivered as clear messages, color-coded alerts (red/yellow/green), and dashboard icons for instant recognition.
6. Real-Time and Personalized Updates
•	The algorithm runs automatically whenever a transaction or budget is added, edited, or deleted.
•	Recommendations are personalized for each category and updated in real time, ensuring users always see the latest guidance.




Chapter 5: Implementation and Testing
5.1 Implementation
5.1.1 Tools Used
The implementation of PFTS involved a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and platforms to ensure user-friendly application. The main tools and technologies used are:
•	Programming Languages:
1.	JavaScript (for both backend and frontend logic)
2.	HTML and CSS (for frontend structure and styling)
•	Frameworks and Libraries:
1.	Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for backend logic.
2.	Express.js: Web application framework for building RESTful routes and handling server-side operations.
3.	EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
4.	Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and modern UI design.
•	Database Platform:
1.	MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing user data, transactions, budgets, and categories.
2.	Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, providing schema definitions and data validation.
•	Other Tools:
1.	Git: Version control for code management and collaboration.
2.	VS Code: Main code editor.
3.	npm (Node Package Manager): For managing project dependencies.
5.1.2 Implementation Details for Modules
The implementation details for some of the core modules of the Personal Finance Tracking System (PFTS) are described as follows:
Authentication Module:
The authentication system handles both user registration and login. Registration requires the user to enter their name, email, and password. The frontend validates the input before sending it to the backend via an API call. On the backend, the password is securely hashed and the user data is stored in the database. For login, the backend verifies the user’s credentials and starts a session if they are valid. Proper error messages are displayed for any invalid input or authentication failure.
Transaction Management Module:
Users can add, view, edit, and delete income or expense transactions from the frontend. Each transaction includes details such as amount, type, category, description, and date. When a transaction is added or modified, the frontend sends the data to the backend, which then updates the MongoDB database. All transactions are linked to the user and can be filtered or paginated as needed.
Budget Management Module:
Users can set up budgets for different categories (e.g., Food, Rent, Utilities) and for specific months. The frontend provides forms for creating and editing budgets, which are sent to the backend for validation and storage. Budgets are associated with users and categories, and the system ensures that only one budget per category per month is allowed for each user.
Category Management Module:
Categories help organize transactions and budgets. The system provides a set of default categories, but may also allow users to add custom categories. Categories are referenced in both the transaction and budget modules to ensure consistency.
Recommendation Module (Budget Pacing Algorithm):
This module continuously analyzes the user’s spending pace compared to their set budgets. Every time a transaction or budget is updated, the backend recalculates the expected spending pace and compares it to actual spending using the formulas described in the algorithm section. The module then generates real-time feedback and recommendations, which are displayed on the dashboard using color codes and messages.
Dashboard and Reporting Module:
The dashboard provides users with a summary of their financial status, including total income, expenses, remaining budget, and pacing feedback. Visual elements such as charts and progress bars are generated using Chart.js on the frontend. Users can also export their transaction data as CSV files for further analysis.
